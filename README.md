## Change Log

### 2.5.1
Fix data for December and January dates #33 by [ewolfe](https://github.com/ewolfe).
Decided to bump up the minor as it was a significant bug fix.

Decision based on [React team's decision](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/12/19/react-v-16-7.html#why-is-this-bugfix-a-minor-instead-of-a-patch) (even though this is not a React component) on releasing v16.7 not including Hooks.

### 2.4.0  
Fixed [ISO8601 date](https://github.com/dance2die/calendar-dates/pull/21) return value to match current date.  
* Thank you again [ewolfe](https://github.com/ewolfe) üëä.

### 2.3.0
1. Returns [ISO8601 date](https://github.com/dance2die/calendar-dates/pull/19).
